  <dl>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-simple"><b>saaj-simple</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample application demonstrates how to send a simple <code>SOAPMessage</code>
from a sender (servlet) to a receiver (servlet). This shows a simple
round-trip message; the receiver responds with a reply. The messages
appear in the directory from which you started the Web container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-book"><b>saaj-book</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample Web application demonstrates how to create and
send a <code>SOAPMessage</code> from a sender (servlet) to a receiver
(servlet). This sample demonstrates how a DOM document can be used in
conjunction with SAAJ. A DOM document is created from information read
from an XML file, and the content is added to the body of a message.
The messages appear in the directory from which you started the Web
container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-translator"><b>saaj-translator</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample uses Altavista's babelfish translation service to
translate text. The text to be translated is sent within a <code>SOAPMessage</code>
to the TranslationService.</p>
      <p> The TranslationService, in turn, talks to
babelfish.altavista.com, making an HTTP connection, and extracts the
translations of the input text string from the response. The text is
translated into German, Italian, and French. </p>
      <p> The translations can be returned either as attachments to a
SAAJ message or within the <code>SOAPBody</code>, depending on which
option is chosen through the radio button from the application's <code>index.html</code>
file. If you use a proxy, the proxy settings (both host and port) need
to be entered.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>saaj/samples/uddiping</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample application is a real-time application that talks
to a live UDDI registry. It sends a <code>SOAPMessage</code> query to
the registry and prints out the message response using the SAAJ API.</p>
      <p> Instructions for running this sample are in a README file in
the <code>uddiping</code> directory.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>saaj/samples/soapprocessor</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample provides an API that implements a <code>SOAPProcessor</code>
object, which implements the processing model described in <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383491">The
SOAP Message Exchange Model</a>. The sample consists of a JAR file,
which can be used by other sample applications, and the associated
source code.</p>
      <p> For more information about this sample, see the README file
in the <code>soapprocessor</code> directory.</p>
